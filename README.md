# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End
The WTWR application allows users to view the current weather for their location. Depending on the weather, an array of clothes will be displayed that can help the user on what to wear. 

This is a back-end project that creates a server for the WTWR application using Node.js, Express.js and Mongodb. With the use of REST API, users can utilize CRUD operations.
